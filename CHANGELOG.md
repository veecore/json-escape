## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-19
### Fixed
- **Unicode escapes:** Truncated sequences like `\uD83D` are now reported as  
  `UnexpectedEof` instead of `LoneSurrogate`.  
  This aligns with [RFC 8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259), `serde_json`,  
  and Goâ€™s `encoding/json`.  
  Example:
  ```rust
  let mut iter = unescape(r"\uD83D");
  let err = iter.next().unwrap().unwrap_err();
  assert!(matches!(err.kind(), UnescapeErrorKind::UnexpectedEof));
````

### Notes

* This changes the exact `UnescapeErrorKind` for truncated surrogate escapes.
  While technically observable, it corrects the behavior to match the JSON spec
  and is therefore treated as a bug fix rather than a breaking change.
